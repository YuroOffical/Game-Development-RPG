## Description
The Game i Created During Semester One, for a first time coder 
with no prior knowledge of C# i'd say i did alright

## Information
Created using Winform as the base of the program and Krita for the artwork
All code was written by me with my team helping in the background
Several QoL Classes Like File Editor, File Reader, Map Generator
It Contains an internal Database using Notepad
It uses code to generate moving images as using Gif would cause too much lag for winform
